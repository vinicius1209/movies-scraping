# Movies Scraping

> "Dashboard that list upcoming movies from TheMovieDB API"

### Architecture

Using Python on the backend of the application was easy to make requisitions to TheMovieDB API. The idea was to use the Requests library to create all the GET methods from a python class that works like a middleware betteween Front and API.
Also, Flask works like a MVC application with the routes and static templates without a lot of configuration like others stacks.
